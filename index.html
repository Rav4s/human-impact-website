      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>Poaching is a widespread issue that's affecting countless countries around the world. Poaching is the illegal hunting or capturing of wild animals. Usually, animals are poached for parts of their bodies, such as a rhino's horn or an elephant's tusks. Poachers can then sell these body parts for millions of dollars on the black market. This illegal hunting can have disastrous effects on the ecosystems of the area, and can even cause certain species to become extinct.</p>

      <h1>Affected Location</h1>
      <p>Kenya has been significantly affected by poaching. It is home to 1,258 rhinos (as of 2017) and has large wildlife reserves to protect these animals. Kenya is also home to the last two surviving Northern White Rhinos. Rhino population has been on a general decline over the last century, but has seen a gradual increase over the last few decades. It is of the utmost importance that we protect these animals, since they play an important role in Kenya's savanna ecosystems. Many species of rhino in Kenya, including the Black Rhino & Javan Rhino, are endangered, and it's crucial for humans to protect them.</p>

        <p>The organisms in green are primary producers and include star grass and acacia. Primary consumers (blue), including the rhino, mouse, termite, and gazelle (all herbivores), consume these producers. The mongoose (secondary consumer) eats the mouse & termite, and is an omnivore. The primary & secondary consumers are eaten by tertiary consumers (yellow), which include the lion, caracal, hyena, and crocodile (all carnivores). Finally, the vulture (detritivore), a quaternary consumer, consumes the remains of all other consumers. Although adult rhinos don't have any predators in the wild, tertiary consumers like lions and hyenas depend on juvenile and baby rhinos for a food source. Poaching rhinos removes a large food source for these tertiary consumers, and can cause their populations to fall.</p>
